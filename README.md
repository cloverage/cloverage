cloverage
=========

Simple clojure coverage tool. Currently requires clojure 1.4.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/lshift/cloverage.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/lshift/cloverage)

## Installation

Add `[lein-cloverage "1.0.2"]` to :plugins in your .lein/profiles.clj

## Testing frameworks support

This library supports clojure.test and Midje.

## Usage

### lein
Run `lein cloverage` in your project. See cloverage/coverage.clj for more
options.

To specify the version of cloverage manually, set the `CLOVERAGE_VERSION`
to desired value, for example `CLOVERAGE_VERSION=1.0.4-SNAPSHOT lein cloverage`

By default, the plugin will use the latest release version of cloverage.

### mvn

There is no maven plugin right now. A workaround is to import this library in the
project being tested, then run:
`mvn exec:java -Dexec.classpathScope=test -Dexec.mainClass='clojure.main' -Dexec.args='--main cloverage.coverage *args-to-coverage*'`

Where *args-to-coverage* will usually be something like "-n 'ns.regex.*' -t 'text.ns.regex.*'"


## Troubleshooting

    IllegalArgumentException No matching field found: foo for class user.Bar  clojure.lang.Reflector.getInstanceField (Reflector.java:271)

This is usually caused by protocols with methods starting with -. Before clojure 1.6:
```
user=> (defprotocol Foo (-foo [x] x))
Foo
user=> (deftype Bar [] Foo (-foo [_] "foo"))
user.Bar
user=> (-foo (Bar.))
"foo"
user=> ((do -foo) (Bar.))

IllegalArgumentException No matching field found: foo for class user.Bar  clojure.lang.Reflector.getInstanceField (Reflector.java:271)
```

Since cloverage *will* wrap the -foo symbol to track whether it's accessed, you will get this error. Upgrade to clojure 1.6.
