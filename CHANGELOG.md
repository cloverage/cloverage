  - Fixes [#345](https://github.com/cloverage/cloverage/issues/345)
  - Fixes [#347](https://github.com/cloverage/cloverage/issues/347)

  - Fixes [#331](https://github.com/cloverage/cloverage/issues/331)
- Upgrade various dependencies
  - Fixes [218](https://github.com/cloverage/cloverage/issues/218)

  - Fixes [334](https://github.com/cloverage/cloverage/issues/334) 

Also some more development niceties, like improvements to CI (including a
proper CircleCI test matrix).

## 1.2.3

- Fix loss of isolated namespaces during reordering (#312)

Also a bunch of internal development niceties, like improvements to CI and
resource management. Shouldn't be externally visible.

## 1.2.2

- Use known data readers while reading forms (#313)
- Support for eftest as a test runner with `--runner :eftest` (#314)

## 1.2.1

- Bugfixes
  - Fix broken instrumentation when a symbol naming a special form such as
    `var` or `new` was defined in the current namespace or used in a local
    `let` binding (#247, #280, #301)
  - Fix the order in which namespaces get instrumented, which could case false
    negatives in forms that are only evaluated the first time the namespace is
    loaded (#294, #302, #303)
  - Fix instrumention of inlined function calls like `int` (#277, #304)
  - Performance improvements (#304)
  - Instrument the class-or-instance part of Java interop forms (#306, #307)
  - Propagate tag metadata when instrumenting function call forms (#308, #310)
  - Fix instrumenting static interop calls (#309, #311)

## 1.2.0 (BUGFIX RELEASE)

1.1.3, specifically PR #292, introduced a regression that caused some
expressions to be evaluated twice, breaking tests. #299 introduces an
alternative implementation that maintains the metadata capturing behavior but
appears to resolve the regression.

This was the only change: everyone on 1.1.3 should upgrade to 1.2.0.

## 1.1.3

Thanks to everyone who contributed this release! A _lot_ of people ended up
scratching their own itches and making Cloverage better for everyone. Particular
thanks to @camsaul for a _ton_ of improvements that were a pleasure to
